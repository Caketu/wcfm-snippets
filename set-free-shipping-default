/*
We get a lot of vendors confused with how to set up their shipping rates. 
When allowing vendors to choose a method (By Zone, Weight or Distance), the UI is initially confusing.
Using the below function, we tie into the new store created hook.
When a vendor signs up, we enable their shipping for them, along with setting "by_zone" and then add the method "Free Shipping"
This means the vendor can add their products without having to worry about shipping

Copy this function into your own plugin or functions.php file
